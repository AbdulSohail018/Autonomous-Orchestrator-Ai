Just launched an Autonomous Data Pipeline Orchestrator - a self-healing data pipeline that uses AI agents to automatically handle operational issues.

The system monitors data ingestion from Kafka through Spark to Snowflake, detects anomalies like schema drift and late arrivals, and autonomously decides on remediation strategies without human intervention.

Key capabilities:
• Real-time schema drift detection with automatic remapping
• Intelligent handling of late-arriving data using watermarks
• Data quality monitoring with Great Expectations integration
• AI-powered decision making using LangChain agents
• Smart remediation: auto-fix, quarantine, retrigger, or escalate
• Complete observability with incident tracking and notifications

Built on a modern stack: Kafka for streaming, Spark for processing, Airflow for orchestration, Snowflake for storage, and LangChain for autonomous decision making. Fully containerized with Docker for seamless deployment.

The goal was to reduce the 60-70% of engineering time typically spent on pipeline maintenance and firefighting, enabling teams to focus on building rather than fixing.
